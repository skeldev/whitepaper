## Introduction

In a world of fleeting hype coins, $SKELSUI rises as the eternal skeleton‚Äîunbreakable, undead, and always coming back stronger.  

Launched on **Sui Network** in August 2025, $SKELSUI draws from the timeless symbol of bones: resilience, transparency, and unkillable energy.  

The Sui blockchain provides the perfect foundation‚Äî**fast, scalable, and cheap**‚Äîfor SKELSUI‚Äôs meme economy. The community drives it all through memes, raids, and collaborations with allied tokens like **$MBP (ManBearPig)**, **$MANNI**, **$PANDA**, and **$WHEELS**.  

**Mission:** To build an immortal memecoin ecosystem on Sui that rewards loyalty, amplifies creativity, and channels the power of collective energy.
